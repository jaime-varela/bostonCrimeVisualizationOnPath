# bostonCrimeVisualizationOnPath
Uses google maps API and the boston crime database to get summary statistics on a walking path


Essentially a way to practice geopandas and useful code in case I need to work on spatial data.

The main code is in `crimes-path-analysis.ipynb`.  Likely it can't be viewed on github due to rendering issues but
it can be viewed [at this location](https://nbviewer.org/github/jaime-varela/bostonCrimeVisualizationOnPath/blob/main/crimes-path-analysis.ipynb) , which uses nbviewer.
